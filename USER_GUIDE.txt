📌 IMPORTANT NOTE:
-----------------
This application uses Python for 100% camera compatibility.
The Python version works perfectly (you already tested it!).

EXE version has camera issues (common OpenCV + PyInstaller problem).
So we recommend using the Python version - it's fast, reliable, and easy!
